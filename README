This is code transcribed, modified or created by Stephen P. Schaefer as he
works the examples in "Erlang and OTP in Action" by Logan, Merritt, and
Carlsson, published by Manning.  I find the exercises quite useful, and
very much recommend the book.

The authors have graciously provided the code with an MIT license, as declared
here: http://www.manning-sandbox.com/thread.jspa?threadID=46558&tstart=0

I've typed the code in rather than cloning the git repository, so as to
learn how to understand and correct my errors.  I've also made modifications;
don't rely on this code as you would the original author's!
