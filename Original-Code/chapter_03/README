To build this code, run the following command:

erlc *.erl

To run the program, start Erlang (in the same directory),
then run the following in the Erlang shell:

1> tr_server:start_link().
{ok,<0.34.0>}
2> 

After that, open another terminal window and use telnet
to connect to the application, like this:

$ telnet localhost 1055
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.localdomain.
Escape character is '^]'.
lists:reverse([1,2,3]).
[3,2,1]
init:stop().
ok
Connection closed by foreign host.
